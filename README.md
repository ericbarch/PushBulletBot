# PushBulletBot
A bot that uses PushBullet's API to notify me of stuff. This is very sloppy python code, feel free to contribute and clean it up.

Make sure to go to https://weather.codes and search for your location, and plop it into the weatherCode variable.

Feel free to use this code, just give me credit if you decide to upload a modified version.

#Installation
Make sure you have PushBullet installed on your android device (This is coming soon to iOS!)

Make sure you have pip installed, if not, do it [Here.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/software/python.md)

If you have pip installed already, cd to your desktop (or wherever you saved `requirements.txt`) (Most RaspPi's desktop are located like the following image)

After that is completed, type `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

And then enter your password.
